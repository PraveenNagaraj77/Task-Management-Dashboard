# Task Management Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Task Management Dashboard** is a web application designed to help users manage and organize their tasks in a visually appealing and intuitive manner. It is built using **React** for the frontend, and it uses a mock REST API to handle CRUD operations on tasks. The dashboard displays tasks in a **Kanban-style board** with three columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

### Key Features:
- **Kanban-style Task Board**: Tasks are displayed in columns based on their status.
- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks by providing a title, description, and status.
- **Update Task Status**: Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The application layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
  
### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap, React Icons
- **API**: Mock REST API using Axios for task management
